onload becomes just $(function(){ ... }); called onDOMReady function.
sizzle = use css in javascript to select elements.
Now we've selected. Next comes manipulation.
You can chain methods! When using jQuery, CHAIN LIKE A BITCH!!
Don't requery! Don't select the same thing multiple times. Use Caching!
Save a selection as a variable and call the variable.
Use a $ sign infront of the variable to remind yourself that you've already masured it.
var $myDiv = $(#myDiv);
$myDiv.show()...

add return false at the end of functions to keep things safe. It stops prevent default and event bubbling.
prevent default to stop the normal behaviour from happening.
bubbling is the code going back up the DOM telling everything else that it happened.

You can trigger things to happen in the console.
$('#id').trigger('click')

animate.css adds animations by just adding classes

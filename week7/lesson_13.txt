S3 POCKETS
Your own personal CDN.
Put all your files in there so you can call that URL and don't have to host it on your server.

Now most of the control happens on the client side
since doing HTML request to the server is costly.

SPAs: The site loads synchronously first then the rest is asynchronous.
Ask the server for the first page then the rest is calculated on the client.

REACTive programming is about watching data.
I have a collection of things. When I press a button, change this collection of things.
It is constantly watching and then redraws the page for you.
You don't have to traverse the DOM to change bits one by one.

React belongs to Facebook
Angular is Google's
Vue.js - favourite
Backbone to monitor the data but otherwise is old

** Component-based architecture **
Break your HTML into separate files and call up the bits in the index.hbs
.hbs which is like PHP
You can move components about the page to change the layout.

** Virtual DOM **
(there used to be a shadow DOM)
Changing the DOM is costly. Think of a puzzle where you are trying to put in one puzzle piece at a time.
Batch the changes you want to make to the DOM.
Eg. create a list in memory with all the items and push in the entire list at once
Virtual DOM is an in memory DOM. Does all the calculations in memory.
Then you re-render and it pushes the whole thing into the real DOM.

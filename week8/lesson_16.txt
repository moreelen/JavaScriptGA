Classes

class Dog { ... };
class Dog {
  constructor(name, breed){
    this.name = name;
    this.breed = breed;
  } // DO NOT ADD COMMAS BETWEEN THE METHODS
  speak(){ ... }
  static getAGeinDogYears(age){
    return age * 7;
  }
}
You will get hoisting issues defining classes. Define classes first and use them second.

Static methods are in the class but they do not get outputted.
Use it to calculate things within the class.
Eg. Dog.getAGeinDogYears(3) will return 3 * 7.

class Dog extends Animal { ... }; cretes a subclass.
Must call super at the beginning of the construtor to call up the features of the original class.
